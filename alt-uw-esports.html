                     	<h2>Context</h2>
                     	<p>In 2014, University of Washington won the League of Legends <b>North American Collegiate Championship</b>, winning <u>$52,000 in scholarships</u>. The next year, UW failed to even qualify. This decline was caused primarily by the lack of infrastructure at UW to produce a top-tier eSports team and last minute player conflicts and negotiations between multiple teams wishing to represent the University of Washington. With these events fresh in mind I set out to find a way to prevent conflicts of a similiar nature </p>

                     	<h2>Identifying Objectives</h2>
                    	<p>To solve these problems, we first identify the objectives of our original solution. After meeting, interviewing, and brainstorming with various key stakeholders; the following objectives were identified:</p>
						<ul class="blog-list">
							<li>Establish a team that will give University of Washington the highest chance to <u>win the collegiate league.</u></li>
							<li>Provide <u>support and resources</u>, to players so that they can succeed and meet both personal and team goals.</li>
							<li><u>Develop players and personnel</u> to ensure the long-term success of University of Washington in collegiate eSports.</li>
							<li><u>Represent the University of Washington</u> and its students in a manner that reflects the values of our school and demonstrates professionalism.</li>
							<li><u>Lobby</u> relevant parties for <i>recognition and increased support</i> from within University of Washington administration.</li>
						</ul>
						<h2>Exsisting Infrastructure Analysis</h2>
						<p>Creating these objectives from the expectations and hopes of the various key steak holders within the environment allow us to gauge the effectiveness of our current solution and identify the ways in which it does not.</p>
						
						<p>After careful analysis, the primary takeaways were the following:</p>
						<ul class="blog-list">
							<li>Students need to be able to <u>tryout out on an individual basis</u> and  the tryout proccess needs to be <i>transparent and fair</i> to everyone.</li>
							<li>Teams need to maintain strong relationships with the communities that they are derivatives of but have enough independance to focus on playing the game.</li>
							<li>Teams need to have a <u>standardized structure</u> to how they approach their games and have <u>consistent oversight</u> to assist teams in meeting there goals and resolving conflicts.</li>
							<li>UW eSports needs a <u>brand that represents UW</u> across all games in a way that is <i>consistent, professional, and promotes UW values.</i></li>
							<li>The primary responsibility for players should be playing to the best of their abilities and other responsibilities should be transfered or minimized</li>
							<li>UW's eSports teams need a <u>unified and organized lobbying effort</u> to connect with the UW administration for recognition and increased support.</li>
						</ul>

						<h2>Fleshing Out a Solution</h2>
						<p>After discussing potential solutions and options to achieve our identified objectives, it became apparent that it would be difficult for an exsisting organization to achieve these ideals while in turn focusing on their original programming. Also, choosing which organization and how they would do it within that organization would also be difficult to decide as every club already has a vested interest into the teams they support for their games.</p>

						<p>With these considerations in mind, the decision to <strong>form an eSports organization</strong> for UW was made. This way the organization would be a neutral party between clubs, be a professional brand that could help unite the competitive aspects of each club, and give students a clear understanding where to go if they wished to be apart of an eSports team.</p>

						<h2>Planning an eSports Organization</h2>
						<p>While it would have been ideal to actively strive for each objective. Not wanting to spread resources too thin it was decided to focus on three of the five objectives.</p>
						<ul class="blog-list">
							<li>Establishing a team</li>
							<li>Creating a brand</li>
							<li>Setting up organizational structure and resources</li>
						</ul>
